<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p>I am a cryptography engineer/consultant at <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec protocol</a> (July, 2021 - present). I completed my Ph.D. from <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a>, Mumbai, India on August, 2021. I was fortunate to work here with my advisor <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sarva/">Prof. Saravanan Vijayakumaran</a>. During my Ph.D. tenure, I worked on privacy in blockchain, applied cryptography, and error correcting codes for flash memories. My thesis can be found <a href="/homepage/thesis/thesis_final.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>The focus of my Ph.D. thesis is to propose proof of reserves protocols for cryptocurrency exchanges. These cryptographic protocols ensure that the exchange publishing the reserves proofs owns a certain amount of reserves to meet the liabilities to its customers. The protocols also strive to preserve the privacy of the exchange and the underlying cryptocurrency technologies.</p>

<p>Prior to joining IIT Bombay, I did my master of engineering (ME) at <a href="https://www.iiests.ac.in/">Indian Institution of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur</a>. Here I have worked on encoding techniques of LDPC codes and was fortunate to be adviced by <a href="https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/Faculty/telecom-ankita">Prof. Ankita Pramanik</a>.</p>

<p>After finishing my B.Tech from <a href="https://www.ticollege.ac.in/">Techno India Salt Lake</a>, I have worked as an assistant system engineer in <a href="https://www.tcs.com/">Tata consultancy Services Ltd.</a> for about two years before joining IIEST, Shibpur for ME.</p>
