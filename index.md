# About 
I worked as a cryptography engineer at [Aztec protocol](https://aztec.network/) (July, 2021 - March, 2023). I completed my Ph.D. from [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/), Mumbai, India on August, 2021. I was fortunate to work here with my advisor [Prof. Saravanan Vijayakumaran](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sarva/). During my Ph.D. tenure, I worked on privacy in blockchain, applied cryptography, and error correcting codes for flash memories. My thesis can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/thesis/thesis_final.pdf).

The focus of my Ph.D. thesis is to propose proof of reserves protocols for cryptocurrency exchanges. These cryptographic protocols ensure that the exchange publishing the reserves proofs owns a certain amount of reserves to meet the liabilities to its customers. The protocols also strive to preserve the privacy of the exchange and the underlying cryptocurrency technologies.  

Prior to joining IIT Bombay, I did my master of engineering (ME) at [Indian Institution of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/). Here I have worked on encoding techniques of LDPC codes and was fortunate to be adviced by [Prof. Ankita Pramanik](https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/Faculty/telecom-ankita).

After finishing my B.Tech from [Techno India Salt Lake](https://www.ticollege.ac.in/), I have worked as an assistant system engineer in [Tata consultancy Services Ltd.](https://www.tcs.com/) for about two years before joining IIEST, Shibpur for ME.
